PHP Price Per Web App

This application is designed to read a text file database of grocery store items and calculate the cheapest price per unit instance of
each item.  The main form and html content is included in phpsorter.php, run this first.  Once data has been entered into the form and has
been validated you can submit the information to the database.  POST will direct to writer.php and confirm that the transaction is
successful. From there you can navigate back to phpsorter.php with the GO BACK button and the new data will be at the end of the list.
